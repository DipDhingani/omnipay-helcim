# Omnipay: Helcim Gateway

**Helcim driver for the Omnipay PHP payment processing library**

Work in progress. First thing to get working is the Helcim Hosted Pages for purchases.

This package is a driver for Omnipay. Being a *driver* rather than an *interface*, it does not 
interface directly with the Helcim service, but rather tells Omnipay how to interact.

This package provides the namespace `Omnipay/Helcim`

It supports both GET and POST. It will aim to support all features and actions of the gateway,
but starting just with the Hosted Pages mode for use on a current project (the itch being scratched).
